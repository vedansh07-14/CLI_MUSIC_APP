## Usage

Install the umbrella (all atoms):

```
npm install @audio/stretch
```

```js
import { transient, wsola } from '@audio/stretch'

let slower = transient(samples, { factor: 2 })          // 2× slower, same pitch
let fast   = wsola(samples, { factor: 0.75 })           // 1.33× faster

let write = transient({ factor: 1.5 })                  // real-time streaming
write(block1)
write(block2)
write()                                                  // → remaining samples
```

Or install just the atom you need — each is self-contained:

```
npm install @audio/stretch-transient
```

```js
import transient from '@audio/stretch-transient'
let out = transient(samples, { factor: 2 })
```

> `Float32Array` in/out; a channel array `[L, R]` (or `Float64Array`) is accepted and processed per channel — parity with `@audio/shift`. Output sizes may be variable — small or empty early chunks are normal in streaming.

## Time domain

### `wsola` — `@audio/stretch-wsola`

Waveform Similarity Overlap-Add. Divides signal into overlapping frames and places them at new synthesis positions, but before placing each frame searches ±delta samples for the read position that maximizes cross-correlation with the natural progression of the previous grain through the input — eliminating the phase cancellation (flanging) of plain OLA. No FFT overhead.

```js
import wsola from '@audio/stretch-wsola'

wsola(data, { factor: 1.5 })
wsola(data, { factor: 0.5, delta: 512 })
```

| Param | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `factor` | `1` | Time stretch ratio |
| `frameSize` | `2048` | Window size |
| `hopSize` | `frameSize/4` | Hop between frames |
| `delta` | `frameSize/4` | Search range (±samples) |

**Use when:** Speech, real-time with tight CPU budgets, moderate ratios (0.5–2×).<br>
**Not for:** Polyphonic music with sustained tones — frequency-domain methods handle harmonics better.


### `psola` — `@audio/stretch-psola`

Pitch-Synchronous Overlap-Add. Detects pitch period via autocorrelation, then windows grains at pitch cycle boundaries. Because grains align with the pitch cycle there are no phase discontinuities at overlaps — cleaner than WSOLA for monophonic pitched signals.

```js
import psola from '@audio/stretch-psola'

psola(data, { factor: 1.5 })
psola(data, { factor: 0.75, sampleRate: 48000 })
psola(data, { factor: 2, minFreq: 100, maxFreq: 400 })  // male voice range
```

| Param | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `factor` | `1` | Time stretch ratio |
| `sampleRate` | `44100` | For pitch detection frequency range |
| `minFreq` | `80` | Lowest expected pitch (Hz) |
| `maxFreq` | `500` | Highest expected pitch (Hz) |

**Use when:** Speech, solo vocals, monophonic instruments, factors 0.5–2×.<br>
**Not for:** Polyphonic material — autocorrelation finds one pitch period so chords get mangled. Extreme ratios (>2×) cause gaps.


## Frequency domain

### `pvoc` — `@audio/stretch-pvoc`

Plain phase vocoder. Each bin's phase advances at its instantaneous frequency independently. Magnitudes are preserved but incoherent inter-harmonic phase relationships give complex signals a diffuse, "underwater" quality.

```js
import pvoc from '@audio/stretch-pvoc'
pvoc(data, { factor: 2 })
```

| Param | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `factor` | `1` | Time stretch ratio |
| `frameSize` | `2048` | FFT size (power of 2) |
| `hopSize` | `frameSize/4` | Hop between frames |

**Use when:** Educational baseline, simple tonal signals.<br>
**Not for:** General music — use [`pvoc-lock`](#pvoc-lock) or [`transient`](#transient).


### `pvoc-lock` — `@audio/stretch-pvoc-lock`

Phase-locked vocoder (Laroche & Dolson, 1999). After propagating phases, locks non-peak bins to their nearest spectral peak's rotation. Restores harmonic phase coherence, eliminating phasiness.

```js
import pvocLock from '@audio/stretch-pvoc-lock'
pvocLock(data, { factor: 2 })
```

Same options as [`pvoc`](#pvoc).

**Use when:** General music — tonal/ambient material where transient resets aren't needed.<br>
**Not for:** Percussive material where attacks matter — use [`transient`](#transient).


### `pghi` — `@audio/stretch-pghi`

Phase Gradient Heap Integration — "Phase Vocoder Done Right" (Průša & Holighaus, 2017). Synthesis phase is integrated from the analysis phase gradients, visiting bins in magnitude order via a max-heap: no peak picking, no transient heuristics; chirps, vibrato and glides stay coherent by construction.

```js
import pghi from '@audio/stretch-pghi'

pghi(data, { factor: 2 })
```

| Param | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `factor` | `1` | Time stretch ratio |
| `frameSize` | `2048` | FFT size (power of 2) |
| `hopSize` | `frameSize/8` | Hop — gradient integration wants dense frames |
| `tolerance` | `1e-6` | Bins below `tolerance×max` get random phase |

**Use when:** modulated material — vibrato, glissandi, pitch-unstable sources.<br>
**Not for:** steady polyphony — [`pvoc-lock`](#pvoc-lock)'s identity locking reproduces intra-partial phases exactly where gradient integration only approximates them.


### `transient` — `@audio/stretch-transient`

Transient-aware phase-locked vocoder (Röbel, 2003). Measures spectral flux between frames; on a sharp onset it resets to the original analysis phase instead of propagating it, preserving attack sharpness on drums and plucks. Implies phase locking.

```js
import transient from '@audio/stretch-transient'

transient(data, { factor: 2 })
transient(data, { factor: 1.5, transientThreshold: 2.0 })  // less sensitive detection
```

| Param | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `factor` | `1` | Time stretch ratio |
| `frameSize` | `2048` | FFT size (power of 2) |
| `hopSize` | `frameSize/4` | Hop between frames |
| `transientThreshold` | `1.5` | Spectral flux threshold (higher = fewer resets) |

**Use when:** The right default for most music — percussion, mixed sources.<br>
**Not for:** Voice/speech — use [`psola`](#psola). Extreme stretch — use [`paulstretch`](#paulstretch).


### `hybrid` — `@audio/stretch-hybrid`

Harmonic/percussive hybrid (Driedger & Müller). Median-filter HPSS splits the spectrogram into two layers; the harmonic layer goes through the phase-locked vocoder, the percussive layer through short-frame OLA — chords stay coherent and attacks stay sharp, where one algorithm must trade one for the other.

```js
import hybrid from '@audio/stretch-hybrid'

hybrid(data, { factor: 2 })
```

| Param | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `factor` | `1` | Time stretch ratio |
| `frameSize` | `2048` | FFT size for HPSS + harmonic path |
| `percFrame` | `512` | OLA frame for the percussive layer |
| `harmMedian` | `17` | Median filter across time (frames) |
| `percMedian` | `17` | Median filter across frequency (bins) |

**Use when:** full mixes — drums over tonal material.<br>
**Cost:** separation + two stretches ≈ 4–6× the CPU of [`pvoc-lock`](#pvoc-lock) alone.


### `paulstretch` — `@audio/stretch-paulstretch`

Extreme time stretching via phase randomization (Nasca, 2006). Preserves magnitudes but replaces all phases with random values, producing smooth, dreamlike textures. Designed for large factors.

```js
import paulstretch from '@audio/stretch-paulstretch'

paulstretch(data, { factor: 8 })
paulstretch(data, { factor: 100, frameSize: 8192 })
```

| Param | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `factor` | `8` | Time stretch ratio (best >2×) |
| `frameSize` | `4096` | FFT size (larger = smoother) |
| `seed` | `0x1f123bb5` | PRNG seed (deterministic output) |

**Use when:** Ambient music, sound design, drone generation, 8×–1000× stretch.<br>
**Not for:** Small ratios (<2×) — sounds washed out. Not for preserving rhythm or transients.


## Sinusoidal

### `sms` — `@audio/stretch-sms`

Sinusoidal Modeling Synthesis (Serra 1989, McAulay-Quatieri 1986). Decomposes audio into individually tracked sinusoidal partials and resynthesizes at the new time rate. Each partial's frequency and magnitude are interpolated independently — no phase spreading or bin-by-bin artifacts.

```js
import sms from '@audio/stretch-sms'

sms(data, { factor: 2 })
sms(data, { factor: 0.5, maxTracks: 80 })
sms(data, { factor: 3, frameSize: 4096 })
```

| Param | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `factor` | `1` | Time stretch ratio |
| `frameSize` | `2048` | FFT frame size |
| `hopSize` | `frameSize/4` | Hop between frames |
| `maxTracks` | `60` | Max simultaneous sinusoidal tracks |
| `minMag` | `1e-4` | Peak detection threshold (linear) |
| `freqDev` | `3` | Max frequency deviation (bins) for track continuation |
| `residualMix` | `1` | Stochastic residual blended into the sinusoidal output |

**Use when:** Harmonic / tonal content — instruments, chords, vocals — where the phase vocoder introduces smearing. Default `residualMix=1` blends breath, noise, and transient energy alongside the sinusoidal model.<br>
**Not for:** Noise-dominated material.


## Quality metrics — `@audio/quality`

Every atom is self-contained (framing/OLA helpers inlined; the phase-locking engine lives in [`@audio/spectral-pvoc`](https://github.com/audiojs/spectral)). Output quality is evaluated with [`@audio/quality`](https://github.com/audiojs/measure):

```js
import { lsd, spectralSim, chordBalance, chordRetention, modulationDepth } from '@audio/quality'
```

`lsd` (log-spectral distance), `spectralSim` (cosine similarity), `chordBalance`, `chordRetention`, and `modulationDepth` (AM depth per partial) evaluate algorithm output against a reference.
